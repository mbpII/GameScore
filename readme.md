# Game Score App

## Project Overview
This project utilizes publicly available sports betting data, such as over/under and point spread odds, to determine which games are likely to be the most entertaining to watch. The motivation is to leverage gambling numbers to make informed decisions about game viewing, without the intention of gambling or betting, in an effort to turn the negative impact of the gambling epidemic—exacerbated by the constant barrage of sports betting promotions—into a positive outcome.
## Objectives
- Use publicly available sports betting data to predict game entertainment value
- Leverage math, analytical, and computer science skills
- Explore potential applications of machine learning techniques

## Methodology
1. Collect and analyze publicly available sports betting data
2. Develop algorithms to assess game entertainment value
3. Implement machine learning models to refine predictions and improve accuracy

## Skills and Technologies
- Mathematical modeling
- Data analysis
- Computer science principles
- Machine learning

## Why This Project?
This project serves as an experiment to hone various technical skills while providing a practical application in a real-world scenario. It combines data analysis, mathematical modeling, and machine learning to create a tool that helps users decide which sports games to watch based on their potential entertainment value.

## Future Directions
- Expand the dataset to include more types of sports and betting markets
- Refine algorithms and machine learning models for better accuracy
- Develop a user-friendly interface to display game recommendations
