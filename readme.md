Project Overview
This project aims to utilize publicly available sports betting data, such as over/under and point spread odds, to determine which games are likely to be the most entertaining to watch. The motivation behind this project is to leverage widely available gambling numbers to make informed decisions about game viewing, without the intention of gambling or betting.
Objectives
Use publicly available sports betting data (over/under and point spread odds) to predict game entertainment value.
Enhance math, analytical, and computer science skills through this project.
Explore the potential application of machine learning techniques in this context.
Methodology
Collect and analyze publicly available sports betting data.
Develop algorithms to assess the entertainment value of games based on the collected data.
Implement machine learning models to refine predictions and improve accuracy.
Skills and Technologies
Mathematical modeling
Data analysis
Computer science principles
Machine learning
